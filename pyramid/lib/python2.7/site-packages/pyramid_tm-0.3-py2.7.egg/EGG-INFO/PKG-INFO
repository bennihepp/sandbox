Description: ``pyramid_tm``
        ==============
        
        ``pyramid_tm`` is a package which allows Pyramid requests to join
        the active transaction as provided by the `transaction
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transaction>`_ package.
        
        See `http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_tm/dev/
        <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_tm/dev/>`_ 
        or ``docs/index.rst`` in this distribution for detailed
        documentation.
        
        
        0.3 (2011-09-27)
        ----------------
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - The transaction manager has been converted to a Pyramid 1.2 "tween"
          (instead of an event subscriber).  It will be slotted directly "below" the
          exception view handler, meaning it will have a chance to handle exceptions
          before they are turned into responses.  This means it's best to "raise
          HTTPFound(...)" instead of "return HTTPFound(...)" if you want an HTTP
          exception to abort the transaction.
        
        - The transaction manager will now retry retryable exceptions (such as a ZODB
          conflict error) if ``pyramid.attempts`` is configured to be more than the
          default of ``1``.  See the ``Retrying`` section of the documentation.
        
        - Python 3.2 compatibility (requires Pyramid 1.3dev+).
        
        Backwards Incompatibilities
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Incompatible with Pyramid < 1.2a1.  Use ``pyramid_tm`` version 0.2 if you
          need compatibility with an older Pyramid installation.
        
        - The ``default_commit_veto`` commit veto callback is no longer configured
          into the system by default.  Use ``tm.commit_veto =
          pyramid_tm.default_commit_veto`` in the deployment settings to add it.
          This is for parity with ``repoze.tm2``, which doesn't configure in a commit
          veto by default either.
        
        - The ``default_commit_veto`` no longer checks for the presence of the
          ``X-Tm-Abort`` header when attempting to figure out whether the transaction
          should be aborted (although it still checks for the ``X-Tm`` header).  Use
          version 0.2 or a custom commit veto function if your application depends on
          the ``X-Tm-Abort`` header.
        
        - A commit veto is now called with two arguments: ``request`` and
          ``response``.  The ``request`` is the webob request that caused the
          transaction manager to become active.  The ``response`` is the response
          returned by the Pyramid application.  This call signature is incompatible
          with older versions.  The call signature of a ``pyramid_tm`` 0.2 and older
          commit veto accepted three arguments: ``environ``, ``status``, and
          ``headers``.  If you're using a custom ``commit_veto`` function, you'll
          need to either convert your existing function to use the new calling
          convention or use a wrapper to make it compatible with the new calling
          convention.  Here's a simple wrapper function
          (``bwcompat_commit_veto_wrapper``) that will allow you to use your existing
          custom commit veto function::
        
             def bwcompat_commit_veto_wrapper(request, response):
                 return my_custom_commit_veto(request.environ, response.status, 
                                              response.headerlist)
        
        Deprecations
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The ``pyramid_tm.commit_veto`` configuration setting is now canonically
          spelled as ``tm.commit_veto``.  The older spelling will continue to work,
          but may raise a deprecation error when used.
        
        0.2 (2011-07-18)
        ----------------
        
        - A new header ``X-Tm`` is now honored by the ``default_commit_veto`` commit
          veto hook. If this header exists in the headerlist, its value must be a
          string. If its value is ``commit``, the transaction will be committed
          regardless of the status code or the value of ``X-Tm-Abort``. If the value
          of the ``X-Tm`` header is ``abort`` (or any other string value except
          ``commit``), the transaction will be aborted, regardless of the status code
          or the value of ``X-Tm-Abort``.
